## Questions

- Should I be seperating my css in multiple files, if so, does the order matter ?

Ans: It is best practice for your code to be as clear and concise as possible, so it usually helps
to seperate your css file into multiple, and no! the order should not matter. 

SELECT * FROM users -> Select everything
SELECT email FROM users -> Select email only

# Reminders

- README (DB/Project Set Up Instructions, Project up and Running Instructions, Dependencies)
- Screenshots (tips)
- Keeping dollar value, and not using cents instead "addProperty"
- Quries get returned back as an array
- Comments (as concise as possible, remove any usefule ones)
- Github (have multiple commits avoid only using 1)

3 Ways to run your code: 
1. \i filename
2. pg library (with Js)
3. Directly in the SQL shell
